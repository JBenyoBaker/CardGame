After you start the game the program will print out your hand. Once this happens you will have to option to remove 0, 1, 2, or  3  cards from your hand. If you choose to remove cards from your hand you will specify which card via the index of the card, labeled under the cards in the window. Then the program will reveal to you the randomly generated hand of the computer, as well as tell you who wins the round. Next, you will have the option to play another round, either type y, or n into the terminal to specify your choice. The game will go on for up to 3 rounds. Good luck!
